            <p class="fade-down fade-delay-7">
              My personal mantra reminds me to create with intention, inspire with passion, and innovate with purpose and care.
              As a product manager, I pride myself on being customer-obsessed, always striving to envision delightful experiences. I'm constantly seeking new opportunities to learn, grow, and stretch my product muscles further.
              <br /><br />
              Beyond product, I’m also a creative technologist passionate about the intersection of technology and artistry — a passion that inspired me to launch my own businesses.
              <br /><br />
              As a committed advocate for diversity and inclusivity, I believe deeply in the power of collaboration and community. I'm always open to connecting, sharing knowledge, and exploring new ideas.
              If you're interested in working together or just want to chat, I’d love to hear from you!
